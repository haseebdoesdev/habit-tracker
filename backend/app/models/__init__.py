"""
SQLAlchemy Models Package
=========================
This package contains all database models for the Habit Tracker.

Import all models here so Alembic can detect them for migrations.
"""

# TODO: Import all models here after they are implemented
# WHY: Alembic needs all models imported in one place to detect schema changes
# APPROACH: Add import statements for each model class

# from app.models.user import User
# from app.models.habit import Habit
# from app.models.log import Log
# from app.models.achievement import Achievement
# from app.models.party import Party
# from app.models.party_member import PartyMember
# from app.models.party_goal import PartyGoal
# from app.models.accountability import AccountabilityPartnership
